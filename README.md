# stream-subscription-ui

By providing an Url and Access Token, this website rips the stream or partitions the stream into `.mp3` file and subsequently uploads the song to a service (ftp, dropbox or etc.)

This service is free, we do not own the ripped `.mp3` files and we do not store them, only store them in your file sharing service.
